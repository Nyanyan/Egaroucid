## About Changing Book Format

Book format is changed in Egaroucid 6.3.0. The new book's filename extension is ```.egbk2```. If you used version 6.2.0 or older and install 6.3.0, Egaroucid automatically translate book format in first execution. Also, you can use old ```.egbk``` book in "Book Reference" and "Book merge", but the save format is only new ```.egbk2```.
